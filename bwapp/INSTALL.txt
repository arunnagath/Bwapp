bee-box - INSTALL
-----------------

bee-box is a custom Linux VM pre-installed with bWAPP.

With bee-box you have the opportunity to explore all bWAPP vulnerabilities!
bee-box gives you several ways to hack and deface the bWAPP website.
It's even possible to hack the bee-box to get root access...


Requirements
////////////

*/ Windows, Linux or Mac OS
*/ VMware Player, Workstation, Fusion or Oracle VirtualBox


Installation steps
//////////////////

No! I will not explain how to install VMware or VirtualBox...

*/ Extract the compressed file.

*/ Double click on the VM configuration file (bee-box.vmx), or import the VM into the VMware software.

*/ Start the VM. It will login automatically.

*/ Check the IP address of the VM.

*/ Go to the bWAPP login page. If you browse the bWAPP root directory you will be redirected.

	example: http://[IP]/bWAPP/
	example: http://[IP]/bWAPP/login.php

*/ Login with the default bWAPP credentials, or make a new user.

	default credentials: bee/bug

*/ You are ready to explore and exploit the bee!


Notes
/////

*/ Linux credentials:

	bee/bug
	root/bug

*/ MySQL credentials:

	root/bug

*/ Modify the Postfix settings (relayhost,...) to your environment.

	config file: /etc/postfix/main.cf

*/ bee-box gives you several ways to deface the bWAPP website.
   It's even possible to hack the bee-box to get root access...

   Have fun!

*/ Take a snapshot of the VM before hacking the bee-box.
   There is also a backup of the bWAPP website (/var/www/bWAPP_BAK).

*/ To reinstall the bWAPP database, delete the database with phpmyadmin (http://[IP]/phpmyadmin/).
   Afterwards, browse to the following page: https://[IP]/bWAPP/install.php

*/ Don't upgrade the Linux operating system, you will lose all fun :)
